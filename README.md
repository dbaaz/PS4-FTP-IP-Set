#How to use
1. Get the latest release at https://github.com/dbaaz/PS4-FTP-IP-Set/releases (Download PS4-FTP-IP-Set.zip)
2. Extract the zip file anywhere
3. Open FTPIPSet.exe > Enter your PS4's IP address and click on Set.

You can use any FTP payload, however, some payloads do not have the ip address at the proper offset. So its best if the one included is used.
